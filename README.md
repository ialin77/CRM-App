# CRM-App

CRM-App or Custom Relationship Management App is a website for managing all your company's relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers.
For the CRM website, I used the Python language for all functionalities, and the entire application was written in PyCharm.

Also, during the realization of the project, I used the Djnago web framework to develop the Custom Relationship Management App.

The applications that make up the project are the following:

• Base - this is the main application of the project where is stored the main template for the front page of the store and the Django template for the front page.

• Userprofile - this is the app of the project where I created the functionalities for login, register, logout, and viewing your profile.

• Dashboard - this is the app responsible for showing the Dashboard page with the leads and the clients of this website.

• Lead - this is the app dedicated to the leads and their functionalities such as adding leads, editing your leads, deleting them, and transforming the leads into clients. Also here I integrated the functionalities of adding a comment to the lead, which is converted automatically to a client comment if the lead is converted to a client, and uploading a file in the lead and

• Client - this is the app dedicated to the client and his functionalities such as adding a client, editing the client, deleting the client, and viewing the details about the client. Also here I integrated the functionality of exporting a CSV file with all clients.

• Team -  this is the last app of the project where I created the practicalities such as viewing the team you belong to, editing the team if you are the owner, or switching your team with another team.

Database
----------
For the database of this project, I used DB SQLite3 for storing all my data of the store.

Front end
-----------
For the front end of the store, I used Django templates where I stored the HTML, Django template tags, and language.

*** The templates and the CSS files used in this project weren't created by me and the design of the website wasn't a priority for me,  I just modified and adapted them for my vision of the store design. ***
